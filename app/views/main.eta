<h1>Shared chores application</h1>

<p>This is an application where you can add chores. Anyone using the application can view the available chores, claim them, and complete them. Payment for chores is done using <code>chorecoins</code>, which is a virtual currency with no practical value.</p>

<p>If you haven't used the application before, you can start by <a href="/auth/register">registering</a>. If you have been here before, just <a href="/auth/login">log in</a>!</p>
